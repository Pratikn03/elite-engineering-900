**A 900+ Problem Engineering Mastery System — Algorithms + ML/AI + Systems (Python)**### A 900+ Problem Engineering Mastery System (Algorithms + DSA + ML/AI + Systems) — Python**Algorithms + ML/AI + Systems — A Structured 900+ Problem Learning Repository (Python)**



---



## What This IsThis repository is my **long-term, structured mastery system**: a curated and organized collection of **900+ engineering problems** in Python.This repository is my long-term **engineering mastery system**: a curated, organized collection of **900+ coding and ML/AI problems** implemented in Python.



A structured collection of **900 engineering problems** I'm working through to build real skill — not just "practice."



This repo covers:It is designed to build (and prove):It is not a random "LeetCode dump."  

- **727 algorithm/DSA problems** (arrays, trees, graphs, DP, etc.)

- **173 ML/AI problems** (classification, deep learning, NLP, CV, ML systems)- **DSA + algorithmic problem-solving mastery**It is a structured training framework designed to build:

- **Progress tracking** to prevent "solve and forget"

- **clean coding + edge-case thinking**- **Interview-level algorithmic strength**

---

- **ML/AI understanding from fundamentals to systems**- **Real ML/AI engineering understanding**

## Why I Built This

- **production-oriented thinking (monitoring, drift, deployment, retraining)**- **Systems thinking (performance, reliability, monitoring, drift, etc.)**

Most people either:

- Grind LeetCode but can't explain ML- **consistent learning discipline over time**- **Consistent documentation + revision habits**

- Build ML projects but fail coding interviews

- Study theory but can't implement anything



I wanted to fix that gap — for myself.This repo is intentionally built as a **single unified system**, not scattered "practice folders."My goal is to convert practice into **repeatable skill**, with a repo structure that is easy to navigate, review, and explain in interviews.



This repo is how I'm building:

> **Strong algorithms + real ML depth + systems awareness**

## ML/AI Track (173 Problems)

It's organized like an internal training curriculum:- `arrays_strings/`

Located in `ml_ai_ds/ml_case_studies/`:

- problems are grouped by real patterns/domains- `hashmap_set/`

| Range | Topic | Examples |

|-------|-------|----------|- each `.py` file is named clearly- `two_pointers/`

| 001-020 | Classification | Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost |

| 021-040 | Regression | Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Time Series |- the repo includes tracking templates- `sliding_window/`

| 041-060 | Unsupervised | K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE |

| 061-080 | Deep Learning | Neural nets from scratch, backprop, optimization |- ML/AI problems are included as first-class content, not "extra"- `stack_queue/`

| 081-100 | Computer Vision | CNN, ResNet, YOLO, GANs |

| 101-125 | NLP | Word2Vec, LSTM, Transformer, BERT |- `linked_list/`

| 126-145 | ML Systems | MLOps, deployment, monitoring, drift |

| 146-160 | Statistics | Hypothesis testing, Bayesian, MCMC |The goal is to turn practice into:- `binary_search/`

| 161-173 | Advanced | Reinforcement Learning, RecSys, GNNs |

✅ **repeatable skill**  - `trees/`

✅ **interview readiness**  - `graphs/`

## Progress Tracking

✅ **engineering maturity**- `dynamic_programming/`

## Repository Structure (High-Level)Each file is named after the real problem (example: `two_sum.py`, `number_of_islands.py`).

This is how I avoid the "I solved it once but forgot everything" trap.

4. Handle edge cases├── ml_ai_ds/              # 173 ML/AI/NLP/CV/Data Science + ML Systems problemsML/AI problems organized by **real ML domains**, not just interview patterns:

5. Analyze time/space complexity

6. Write small tests when useful├── progress/              # tracking + reflection system

If you're looking at this repo:```- `machine_learning/` — core ML from scratch + evaluation

- **Algorithms depth:** Check `trees/`, `graphs/`, or `dynamic_programming/`

- **ML breadth:** Check `ml_ai_ds/ml_case_studies/`- `deep_learning/` — neural nets fundamentals, CNN/RNN/attention concepts

- **Discipline:** Check `progress/` — this isn't a random dump

---- `nlp/` — TF-IDF, similarity, pipelines, basic models

---

- `computer_vision/` — image ops, IOU/NMS, similarity, preprocessing

## What This Shows

# Part 1 — Algorithms / DSA Track (`algorithms_core/`)- `ml_systems/` — drift, monitoring, deployment logic, pipeline design

- ✅ Strong DSA foundations

- ✅ Consistent practice habits

- ✅ Clean code

- ✅ ML understanding beyond sklearnThis track contains **727 problems** organized by core patterns that appear across interviews and real-world engineering.The purpose is to understand **math → code → system**, not just use libraries.

The focus is:---

## What This Doesn't Claim

- recognizing patterns quickly

I'm not claiming I've shipped production systems at a big tech company.

- writing clean and correct solutions### 3) `progress/` (tracking & revision system)

I'm showing that:

- I can learn deeply and independently- handling edge casesThis repo includes a built-in method to track growth:

- I can build structured systems for growth

- I'm ready to contribute as an engineer- explaining complexity + tradeoffs

# Part 3 — Progress Tracking System (`progress/`)

This repo includes built-in tracking templates to make learning measurable:

```
progress/
├── solved_log.md
├── weak_areas.md
├── revisit_list.md
└── monthly_summary.md
```

How I use this:
- **solved_log.md** → logs daily progress
- **weak_areas.md** → tracks what I struggle with (pattern-level)
- **revisit_list.md** → list of problems to redo later
- **monthly_summary.md** → reflection and improvement plan

This is how I prevent "solve and forget."

---

# Part 4 — Templates (`templates/`)

To keep solutions consistent:

- `algorithm_solution_template.py`
- `ml_problem_template.py`

Consistency matters for:
- faster debugging
- better readability
- stronger portfolio quality

---

# How I approach each problem (my standard)

For each file, I aim to include:

1) Clear understanding of the problem  
2) Brute force baseline (if useful)  
3) Optimized approach (pattern-based)  
4) Edge-case handling  
5) Complexity analysis  
6) Small tests (`assert`) when possible  
7) Notes on mistakes or insights (when needed)

---

This repo is how I'm building that thinking.
